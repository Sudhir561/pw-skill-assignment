    "1. Discuss String Slicing and Provide Example?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "String slicing in Python is a technique that allows you to extract a portion (or \"slice\") of a string by specifying a range of indices. \n",
    "This is useful for manipulating and accessing substrings within a larger string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax of String Slicing\n",
    "The basic syntax for slicing a string is-\n",
    "\n",
    "string[start:end:step]\n",
    "\n",
    "start: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).\n",
    "end: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).\n",
    "step: The interval or step size between indices (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Basic Slicing:\n",
    "    \n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "sliced_text = text[0:5]\n",
    "print(sliced_text)  # Output: Hello\n",
    "\n",
    "# The slice [0:5] extracts characters starting from index 0 up to (but not including) index 5. The result is \"Hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Slicing with Omitted start and end:\n",
    "    \n",
    "text = \"Python Programming\"\n",
    "print(text[:6])   # Output: Python\n",
    "print(text[7:])   # Output: Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "# [:6] slices from the start of the string to index 5.\n",
    "# [7:] slices from index 7 to the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)Slicing with Negative Indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Python Programming\"\n",
    "sliced_text = text[-11:-6]\n",
    "print(sliced_text)  # Output: Progr\n",
    "\n",
    "# Negative indices count from the end of the string. -11 corresponds to the 11th character from the end (which is \"P\"), \n",
    "# and -6 is the 6th character from the end (which is \"g\")\n",
    "\n",
    "d)Slicing with a Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"abcdef\"\n",
    "sliced_text = text[0:6:2]\n",
    "print(sliced_text)  # Output: ace\n",
    "\n",
    "# The slice [0:6:2] starts at index 0, ends at index 6 (exclusive), and selects every second character (step of 2). The result is \"ace\".\n",
    "\n",
    "e)Reversing a String with Slicing:\n",
    "    \n",
    " text = \"Python\"\n",

    "2. Explain the key features of list in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are one of the most versatile and widely used data structures. \n",
    "They allow you to store and manipulate an ordered collection of items (elements), \n",
    "which can be of different data types (integers, strings, objects, etc.). \n",
    "Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "a). Ordered\n",
    "Lists maintain the order of elements. This means that elements are stored in a specific sequence, and this sequence is preserved. \n",
    "For example, if you add elements [1, 2, 3] to a list, they will remain in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Mutable\n",
    "Lists are mutable, meaning that you can change their content after creation. You can add, remove, or modify elements within a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list[1] = 10  # Modify the second element\n",
    "print(my_list)   # Output: [1, 10, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "c)Heterogeneous Elements\n",
    "A single list can contain elements of different data types. This makes lists flexible and allows them to store complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, \"Hello\", 3.14, True]\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 'Hello', 3.14, True]\n",
    "\n",
    "d)Dynamic Size\n",
    "Lists in Python can dynamically grow or shrink in size. You don't need to declare the size of a list upfront, and you can add or \n",
    "remove elements as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # Adding an element\n",
    "print(my_list)     # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "my_list.pop()      # Removing the last element\n",
    "print(my_list)     # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "e)Supports Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "Lists support indexing and slicing, allowing you to access or modify elements at specific positions, as well as extract sublists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "print(my_list[1])    # Output: 20 (accessing an element)\n",
    "print(my_list[-1])   # Output: 50 (accessing from the end)\n",
    "print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [20, 30, 40] (slicing)\n",
    "\n",
    "f)Supports Various Operations\n",
    "Lists support a variety of operations, such as concatenation, repetition, membership testing, and built-in functions \n",
    "like len(), min(), max(), sum(), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "another_list = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "combined_list = my_list + another_list  # Concatenation\n",
    "print(combined_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "repeated_list = my_list * 2  # Repetition\n",
    "print(repeated_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(2 in my_list)  # Membership testing: Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "g)Versatile Methods\n",
    "Python lists come with a wide range of built-in methods to perform different operations like adding, removing, sorting, and \n",
    "reversing elements.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]\n",
    "my_list.append(9)   # Adds an element to the end\n",
    "my_list.remove(1)   # Removes the first occurrence of the element\n",
    "my_list.sort()      # Sorts the list in ascending order\n",
    "my_list.reverse()   # Reverses the list order\n",
    "print(my_list)      # Output: [9, 5, 4, 3, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "h)Supports Iteration\n",
    "Lists are iterable, meaning you can loop through them using loops like for or comprehensions to process elements.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "for item in my_list:\n",
    "     print(item)      \n",
    "# output: 1,2,3,4,5\n",
    "\n",
    "i)Nested Lists\n",
    "Lists can contain other lists as elements, allowing you to create multi-dimensional lists (lists of lists).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "print(nested_list[1])       # Output: [4, 5, 6] (accessing a sublist)\n",
    "print(nested_list[1][2])    # Output: 6 (accessing an element in a sublist)\n",
    "\n",
    "j) Memory Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lists are implemented as dynamic arrays, meaning they offer memory efficiency by allocating additional space when needed, \n",
    "making them a good choice for dynamic data storage."

    "In Python, lists are mutable, which means you can access, modify, and delete elements. \n",
    "Below are detailed explanations with examples of how to perform these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "a). Accessing Elements in a List\n",
    "You can access elements in a list using indexing. Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element has an index of 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "b)Modifying Elements in a List\n",
    "You can modify elements in a list by assigning a new value to a specific index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a list\n",

    "my_list[-1] = 55\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 25, 30, 40, 55]\n",

    "4) Compare and contrast tuples and lists with examples?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples and lists are both sequence data types in Python that allow you to store collections of items.\n",
    "However, they differ in several key aspects, such as mutability, syntax, and use cases. Below is a comparison of tuples and lists \n",
    "with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "a). Mutability\n",
    "Lists: Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify, add, or remove elements after the list has been created.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# List (Mutable)\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list[1] = 10  # Modify an element\n",

    "\n",
    "# Tuple (Immutable)\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# my_tuple[1] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "b). Syntax\n",
    "Lists: Lists are defined using square brackets [].\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # List\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)  # Tuple\n",
    "Note: A tuple with a single element requires a trailing comma, e.g., (1,).\n",
    "\n",
    "c). Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists: Lists are preferred when you need a collection that is likely to change. \n",
    "They are ideal for scenarios where elements need to be added, removed, or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are preferred when you need a collection that should remain constant. \n",
    "They are often used to represent fixed collections of items, such as coordinates, or \n",
    "when you want to ensure data integrity by preventing modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# List: Shopping cart items (can change)\n",
    "shopping_cart = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "shopping_cart.append(\"orange\")  # Adding an item\n",

    "# Tuple: Coordinates (should not change)\n",
    "coordinates = (10, 20)\n",
    "# coordinates[0] = 15  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "d). Performance\n",
    "Lists: Lists are generally slower than tuples in terms of performance because of their mutability. \n",
    "The overhead of managing the ability to change the list's contents can make operations slightly slower.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are faster than lists because they are immutable. Python can optimize memory and \n",
    "speed when working with tuples, making them more efficient for read-only operations.\n",

    "e). Methods\n",
    "Lists: Lists have a wide range of built-in methods for modifying the list, such as append(), remove(), pop(), extend(), insert(), clear(), \n",
    "sort(), and reverse().\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples have very few built-in methods because they are immutable. The main methods are count() (to count occurrences of an element) \n",
    "and index() (to find the index of an element).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# List methods\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # Adding an element\n",

    "f). Memory Efficiency\n",
    "Lists: Lists consume more memory because they are dynamic and allow modifications. \n",
    "Python allocates extra memory to lists to accommodate future additions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lists: Lists are not hashable, which means they cannot be used as keys in a dictionary or elements in a set.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are hashable (as long as all their elements are hashable), which means they can be used as keys in dictionaries \n",
    "or elements in sets.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dictionary with tuple as a key\n",
    "my_dict = {(\"John\", \"Doe\"): 25}\n",

    "# Trying to use a list as a key will raise a TypeError\n",
    "# my_dict = {[1, 2]: \"value\"}  # TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "\n",
    "g). Unpacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Both lists and tuples support unpacking, allowing you to assign the elements to variables directly.\n",

    "\n",
    "# List unpacking\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "a, b, c = my_list\n",

    "5. Describe the key features  of sets and provide examples  of their use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets in Python are a collection data type that is unordered, mutable, and does not allow duplicate elements.\n",
    "They are useful for storing and manipulating unique items and performing mathematical set operations \n",
    "like union, intersection, and difference. Below are the key features of sets along with examples of their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of Sets in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "a). Unordered Collection\n",
    "Sets do not maintain any specific order of elements. When you print a set, the elements may appear in a different order\n",
    "than they were added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since sets are unordered, they do not support indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like behavior.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4} (order may vary)\n",
    "\n",
    "b). No Duplicate Elements\n",
    "Sets automatically remove duplicate elements. If you add the same element multiple times, it will only be stored once.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4}\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4} (duplicates removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "c). Mutable\n",
    "Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after the set has been created. \n",
    "However, the elements themselves must be immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "my_set.add(4)  # Adding an element\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set.remove(2)  # Removing an element\n",
    "print(my_set)     # Output: {1, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "d). No Indexing or Slicing\n",
    "Since sets are unordered, they do not support indexing or slicing like lists or tuples. You cannot access elements by their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "# print(my_set[0])  # This will raise a TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable\n",
    "\n",
    "e). Supports Mathematical Set Operations\n",
    "Sets provide built-in methods for performing mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Union (elements from both sets)\n",
    "union_set = set1.union(set2)\n",
    "print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intersection (common elements)\n",
    "intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)\n",
    "print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Difference (elements in set1 but not in set2)\n",
    "difference_set = set1.difference(set2)\n",
    "print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Symmetric Difference (elements in either set, but not both)\n",
    "symmetric_difference_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n",
    "print(symmetric_difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "f). Efficient Membership Testing\n",
    "Sets are highly efficient for checking whether an element is present in the set or not. \n",
    "This is due to the underlying implementation using hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if 3 is in the set\n",
    "print(3 in my_set)  # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if 6 is not in the set\n",
    "print(6 not in my_set)  # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "g). Set Comprehension\n",
    "Just like list comprehensions, Python supports set comprehensions to create sets based on existing iterables.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a set of squares of numbers from 1 to 5\n",
    "squares_set = {x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}\n",
    "print(squares_set)  # Output: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}\n",
    "\n",
    "h). Immutable Counterpart: frozenset\n",
    "Python also provides an immutable version of a set called frozenset. Once created, you cannot modify the elements of a frozenset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "print(my_frozenset)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})\n",
    "\n",
    "# my_frozenset.add(5)  # This will raise an AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'\n",
    "\n",
    "i). Set Methods\n",
    "Sets come with various built-in methods to manipulate their elements, including add(), remove(), discard(), pop(), clear(), copy(), and more.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set.add(4)  # Add an element\n",
    "my_set.discard(2)  # Remove an element (no error if element doesn't exist)\n",
    "popped_element = my_set.pop()  # Remove and return an arbitrary element\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {3, 4} (after popping an element)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use Cases for Sets:\n",
    "Removing Duplicates from a List\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert a list to a set to remove duplicate elements, as sets do not allow duplicates.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
    "unique_elements = set(my_list)\n",
    "print(unique_elements)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "*Membership Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are ideal for fast membership testing, such as checking if an element is present in a collection.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "allowed_users = {\"alice\", \"bob\", \"carol\"}\n",
    "print(\"alice\" in allowed_users)  # Output: True\n",
    "Mathematical Set Operations\n",

    "\n",
    "# Add a new key-value pair\n",
    "my_dict['city'] = 'New York'\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "\n",
    "b). Modifying Items in a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify an item in a dictionary, you can assign a new value to an existing key. If the key already exists, its value will be updated.\n",

    "8. Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Dictionary Keys Being Immutable in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable. This is because dictionaries use a hashing mechanism to store and retrieve values efficiently. For a key to be hashable (i.e., to have a consistent hash value), it must be immutable. Immutable objects cannot change once created, ensuring that the hash value remains constant, which is essential for the performance and integrity of the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Immutability of Keys Is Important-\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent Hashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are implemented as hash tables. When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, \n",
    "the key is passed through a hash function that generates a unique hash value. This hash value is used to determine where the value\n",
    "will be stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a key were mutable, changing its value after it was added to the dictionary would change its hash value, leading to inconsistency. \n",
    "The dictionary would no longer be able to locate the key's associated value, resulting in errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Lookups:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since dictionaries rely on hash tables, lookups (checking if a key exists, or retrieving a value by key) are very efficient,\n",
    "typically O(1) in time complexity. This efficiency depends on the immutability of keys because the hash function needs \n",
    "to produce consistent results for the same key.\n",
    "\n",
    "If keys could change, the hash table would need to rehash keys each time they changed, which would significantly reduce performance.\n",
    "Dictionary Integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The immutability of keys also ensures the integrity of the dictionary. If keys could change, it could lead to unpredictable behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a key might suddenly \"disappear\" from the dictionary if its value changes and the hash table can no longer locate it.\n",
    "Examples of Immutable vs. Mutable Objects as Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Objects: These can be used as dictionary keys because they are hashable. Examples include integers, strings, tuples\n",
    "(if they contain only other immutable objects), and frozensets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Objects: These cannot be used as dictionary keys because their hash value can change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include lists, sets, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Using Immutable Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "# Integer as key (immutable)\n",
    "my_dict = {1: \"one\", 2: \"two\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# String as key (immutable)\n",
    "my_dict[\"name\"] = \"Alice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple as key (immutable)\n",
    "my_dict[(1, 2)] = \"coordinates\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dict)\n",
    "# Output: {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 'name': 'Alice', (1, 2): 'coordinates'}\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Using Mutable Keys (Not Allowed)\n",
    "\n",
    "# List as key (mutable) - This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    my_dict = {[1, 2, 3]: \"list as key\"}\n",
    "except TypeError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # Output: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "    \n",
    "c. Example of Dictionary Misbehavior with Mutable Keys (If Allowed)\n",
    "Imagine if Python allowed mutable keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hypothetical situation where mutable objects are allowed as keys\n",
    "# If Python allowed this, modifying the key would break the dictionary's lookup\n",
    "my_dict = {[1, 2]: \"value\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the list (which is mutable)\n",
    "my_key = [1, 2]\n",
    "my_key.append(3)  # Now my_key is [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to access the dictionary with the modified key would fail\n",
    "# because the original hash is no longer valid\n",
    "# (in practice, Python would not allow the list to be a key)\n",
    "print(my_dict[my_key])  # This would lead to an error if lists were allowed as keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The immutability of dictionary keys is a fundamental aspect of Python’s dictionary implementation. \n",
    "It ensures consistent hashing, efficient lookups, and the integrity of the dictionary data structure. \n",
    "Immutable objects like integers, strings, and tuples can be used as dictionary keys, while mutable objects like lists and sets cannot.\n",
    "This restriction is crucial for maintaining the reliability and performance of dictionaries in Python."
